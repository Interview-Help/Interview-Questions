What are different examples of data transformation in ETL?



There are following examples of data transformation:

1.Quality data : Data is fetched from different sources so it needs to be standardized as per the target system.

2.Character set conversion : Need to transform the character sets as per the target systems. (Firstname and last name example).

3.Calculated and derived values: In source system there is first value and second value and in target we need the calculation of first value and second value.

4.Data Conversion in different formats : If in source system date in in DDMMYY format and in target the date is in DDMONYYYY format then this transformation needs to be done during transformation phase of ETL.

· Incremental Load : Populate only delta or new changes data only.

· Full Refresh : Completely erases the data from one or more tables and reload the fresh data just like truncate and load.

What is the difference between data warehouse and database ?

A data warehouse is a database used to store data from homo or heterogeneous sources. It is a central repository of data. The data warehouse is then used for reporting and analytical purposes. A database, on the other hand, is the basis or any data storage. It is an organized collection of data. A database is used to store data while a data warehouse is mostly used to facilitate reporting and analysis.

What is Datamart?

A Data Mart is a subset of a data base that can provide data for reporting and analysis on a section, unit or department. The Data Mart is sometimes also called as HPQS (Higher Performance Query Structure). Example, Bank is known as database while its various units like, Insurance, Finance etc are known as datamart.

 

What is Data cleaning?

Data cleaning is also known as data scrubbing or data qualifying.

Data cleansing is a process that ensures the set of data is correct and accurate. Data accuracy and consistency, data integration is checked during data cleaning. Data cleaning can be applied for a set of records or multiple sets of data that need to be merged.



What is Star schema model in data warehouse?

 A star schema is defined as a logical database design in which there will be a centrally located fact table that is surrounded by at least one or more dimension tables. This design is best suited for Data Warehouse or Data Mart.



What is Snowflake schema model in data warehouse?

A snowflake schema is defined as a logical database design in which there will be a centrally located fact table that can be surrounded by at least one or more dimension tables or with other fact tables which can be surrounded by other dimension tables as well.
